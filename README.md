# NodeJS-Reviewer
MEAN Stack Project

## Project Details
The main goal of this project is to allow me to experiment with the different features available in the MEAN Stack. Straight from
the backend to the frontend design. 

## Development
First I started work on laying out the frontend of the application and then worked my way back, moving the data gradually towards the API / MongoDB database. After finalizing the frontend design and layout, I began work on the API controllers and routes to serve the correct data when requested when navigating the frontend of the application. The application will eventually incorporate the AngularJS framework into the front-end, at it's current stage of development only standard HTML is implemented.

## Refinements
It would been ideal to separate and decouple the data from the frontend application completely so eventually I’ll run the API backend on a different server or virtual machine, as running the frontend and backend on the same server is not good practice, but for testing purposes I’ll leave it for the mean time.

## TODO
Lists the areas of the project I still need to work on / finish.

* Implement the AngularJS front-end framework into the sent HTML
* Finish development of the database API CRUD operations
* Test the functionality of the application in different browsers
